Creating a new Dockerfile is easy. Follow alone to make a new directory
and initialize a new, empty Dockerfile.

1. Create a Dockerfile inside this directory:

::

    $ cd myimage
    $ vim Dockerfile

    NOTE: Vim is used by default, feel free to use another available
    text editor. Ask the instructor if this is confusing.

2. Copy the following text inside the new Dockerfile:

.. raw:: html

   <pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="append"><blockquote>
   FROM ubuntu
   RUN apt-get -y update
   RUN apt-get install -y figlet
   </blockquote></pre>

3. After saving the file, execute as follows:

``docker build -t myfiglet .``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

    Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
    Sending build context to Docker daemon
    Step 0 : FROM ubuntu
    ---> xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Step 1 : RUN apt-get update
    ---> Running in xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ---> xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Removing intermediate container xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Step 2 : RUN apt-get install figlet
    ---> Running in xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ---> xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Removing intermediate container xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Successfully built xxxxxxxxxxxx

    NOTE: Number's will defer depending on the build number, per host.

4. Okay, spin up the new image using the (-it) to ensure our container
is interactive.

``docker run -it myfiglet``\ {{execute}}

5. Now, the fun part! To confirm success, give it the following command,
which is unique to Figlet:

``figlet hello``\ {{copy}}

*Pretty cool, huh?*

And of course, be sure to exit out of your container: ``exit``\ {{copy}}
