Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

We've covered a lot, and we have opened several cans of worms in the
process. In a nutshell this has been only a small introduction into the
use cases and benefits involved in using Dockerfiles. At least now we
know how to create a Dockerfile, build it, explore the history, add
commands, entry points, and how to copy entire apps in. This is not
increditible easy stuff. Now, do a reset and let's move on. Congrats!

Great job!
