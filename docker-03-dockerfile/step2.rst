1. Issue a command to see the history of our newest Dockerfile:

``docker history myfiglet``\ {{execute}}

2. Let's change our Dockerfile to include JSON syntax, as follows:

.. raw:: html

   <pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace"><blockquote>
   FROM ubuntu
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
   </blockquote></pre>

3. Then, build the new Dockerfile again, just as we did before:

``$ docker build -t myfiglet .``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

    ...
    Successfully built xxxxxxxxxxxx

4. Now, compare the new history along side the other:

``docker history myfiglet``\ {{execute}}
