Dockerfile
----------

**Objective:** Participants will learn to Dockerize applications, create
Docker images by using a Dockerfile, and get a more complete look at
individual commands we can utilize.

**Preparation:** Open two Terminal windows, and ``cd`` into the
appropriate Lab folder.

**Outcome:** Don't wanna ruin the surprise, but once you're done you'll
have dockerized a C application and learn about Dockerfiles useing
Figlet, which is a cool, custom made image for learning.

**Data Files:** ``Dockerfile, helloworld.c`` (Both are created during
the lab.)
