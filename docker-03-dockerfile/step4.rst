When we are baking up an image from a dockerfile, we need to consider
which files we might we preinstalled onto our image. For that we will
copy files from the "build context," which is the directory containing
the Dockerfile. We can use this to "dockerize" a application. Check this
out!

1. Let's now create a new directory and name it ``helloworld``.

2. Inside that directory we will create a new file, we will name that
file ``helloworld.c``, and we copy the following content into it:

::

    int main () {
    puts("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
    }

3. Now, from inside our ``helloworld`` directory, create a new
"Dockerfile" and copy the following code into it:

::

    FROM ubuntu
    RUN apt-get update
    RUN apt-get install -y build-essential
    COPY helloworld.c /
    RUN make helloworld
    CMD /helloworld

    **NOTE:** See how we are using the COPY command in our Dockerfile to
    bring our application into our container. This is called
    "dockerizing" and it's very useful.

4. Okay, now for the fun part! We can test our project as we have done
before. First, let's build out our Dockerfile to create the image we
will use, like this:

``docker build -t worldhello .``\ {{execute}}

5. Run it!

``docker run worldhello``\ {{execute}}

Well?
