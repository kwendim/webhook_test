This step will show us how to add two important Dockerfile commands:
``CMD`` and ``ENTRYPOINT``. These two commands are often used and can be
of great benefit. These commands allow us to set a default command to
run in our container.

1. We want to greet people who run a container from our image with a
nice hello, and we want a custom font to be used. For that, we will use
the ``CMD`` to bake ``figlet -f script hello`` inside our Dockerfile
Image.

So, the Dockerfile we are working on should look like:

.. raw:: html

   <pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace"><blockquote>
   FROM ubuntu
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
   CMD figlet -f script hello
   </blockquote></pre>

2. Now that we've made our additions, let's build it:

``docker build -t myfiglet .``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

    ...
    Successfully built xxxxxxxxxxxx

3. Let's run it, like always:

``docker run myfiglet``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

     _          _   _       
    | |        | | | |      
    | |     _  | | | |  __  
    |/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_
    |   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/ 

4. Now, let's try to interject our own message upon running our image,
like this:

``docker run myfiglet howdy!``\ {{execute}}

    **NOTE:** Our attempt to interject our own message fails, as it
    should.

5. Let's replace ``CMD`` now with an ``ENTRYPOINT`` to see if that makes
a difference. Open up the Dockerfile once again, and copy the following
code in place of the existing, like this:

.. raw:: html

   <pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace"><blockquote>
   FROM ubuntu
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
   ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
   </blockquote></pre>

6. Okay, build it:

``docker build -t myfiglet .``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

    ...
    Successfully built xxxxxxxxxxxx

7. And run it:

``docker run myfiglet howdy!``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

     _                               
    | |                    |        |
    | |     __           __|        |
    |/ \   /  \_|  |  |_/  |  |   | |
    |   |_/\__/  \/ \/  \_/|_/ \_/|/o
                                 /|  
                                 \|  

Great job!

8. Almost done! Let's add both ``CMD`` and ``ENTRYPOINT`` to our
Dockerfile. This will give us the option to insert a custom message, or
to print the default message. Confirm that your Dockerfile looks like
this:

.. raw:: html

   <pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace"><blockquote>
   FROM ubuntu
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
   ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
   CMD ["hello world"]
   </blockquote></pre>

9. Let's build it:

``docker build -t myfiglet .``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

    ...
    Successfully built xxxxxxxxxxxx

10. And now run it and include a custom message:

``docker run myfiglet Ahoy``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

      ___,   _                
     /   |  | |               
    |    |  | |     __        
    |    |  |/ \   /  \_|   | 
     \__/\_/|   |_/\__/  \_/|/
                           /| 
                           \| 

11. Alright, if we were successful, we should be able to print our
default message, like this:

``docker run myfiglet``\ {{execute}}

Output:

::

     _          _   _                             _        
    | |        | | | |                           | |    |  
    | |     _  | | | |  __             __   ,_   | |  __|  
    |/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_  |  |  |_/  \_/  |  |/  /  |  
    |   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/    \/ \/  \__/    |_/|__/\_/|_/

    **NOTE:** What if we want to run a shell in our container? We cannot
    just do ``docker run myfiglet bash`` because that would just tell
    figlet to display the word "bash." We use the ``--entrypoint``
    parameter, like this: ``$ docker run -it --entrypoint bash figlet``
