Practice Docker Basics
----------------------

**Objective:** In this lesson we will attempt to fill in some of the
holes from the last lesson, highlight some other helpful commands when
dealing with containers, and look at what to do when we are done using
our container, or image.

**Preparation:** Prepare by opening up two terminal windows. One to
serve as the primary and the other as a secondary. Also, navigate to the
appropriate lab folder, where the lab data/material is.

**Outcome:** This lesson will give the participant a more thorough
overview of Docker. By the end, we’ll have started two separate
containers, created a file in one, start and stop our container, and
then remove it all when we’re done.

**Data Files:** ``hello.py, Dockerfile``

Learning a new technology can be very overwhelming. Docker does a great
job though of indexing with their help menus. In this lab we will learn
more about the lifecycle of containers, how to stop and start them,
execute commands instide them, how to remove them, and how to build an
image from a Dockerfile.
