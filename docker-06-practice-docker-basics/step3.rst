1. Now, leave the container running in your primary terminal window and
preform the following commands in your secondary window, to stop the
latter container:

``docker stop <container-id, or name>``\ {{execute}}

    NOTE: The names (--name) we assigned were Bert and Ernie, and we
    know Ernie is down at this moment. So, Bert is the container name to
    use.

2. Start the container back up now and confirm that ``hello.py`` is
still available:

``docker start <container-id, or name>``\ {{execute}}

    NOTE: This is when the (``--name``) option flag is best served. You
    can also use the first 2-4 numbers of the container-id. Docker will
    pick up on it.

3. Execute a command inside the container, concerning our ``hello.py``
file, using the execute (``exec``) command. Before we run our command
though, let’s look at the syntax of the (``exec``) command by typing
into our terminal ``docker exec``. Now, let’s run ours:

``docker exec <container-id, or name> tail /root/hello.py``\ {{execute}}

4. What if we wanna go back into our contianer? Well, we can use the
execute (``exec``) command for that as well, to invoke our bash shell,
as follows:

``docker exec -it <container-id, or name> bash``\ {{execute}}

5. Then, be sure to exit out of the container by typing
``exit``\ {{copy}} into the appropriate terminal window (Terminal Host
2)
