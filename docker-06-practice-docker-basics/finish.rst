Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

In this lesson we ran multiple run options, the execute command, and
learned to remove both containers and images. We used (``-it``) to spin
up an interactive container and (``-d``) to launch a daemon container.
Then, we created a file, while inside our container, stopped it, and
then started it back up to find our file still intact. Once we finished,
we appropriately removed all our previous containers and images. Now, we
are ready to move on to a new project, but before we do, and this will
be important in every lab, do a general reset. Stop each container
started during this lab. Ask your instructor if you need help doing
this. Be proud of yourself!
