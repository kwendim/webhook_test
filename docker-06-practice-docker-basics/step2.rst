For this step, leave the secondary terminal window and return to the
primary. If that container is not currently active, meaning you are not
still logged into it, repeat point #2 of Step 1, or consult with the
instructor.

1. Take a minute and explore the interactive Ubuntu container we’ve spun
up. Once done, following along further to insure our container is up to
date.

``sudo apt-get update``\ {{copy}}

2. Now, let’s create a file. We will name it ``hello.py`` and you can
fill it up with just about anything you want to. Following along here,
and make sure to put the file in your Home directory.

``cd ~  \ touch hello.py``\ {{copy}}

3. Just to be sure, go ahead confirm the file's creation, just like you
would normally from your CLI.

``ls``\ {{copy}}

4. So, we’ve created our file, let’s go in and fill it up with our code.

``vi hello.py``\ {{copy}}

5. Now, copy and paste the following line into the file:

``hello-world``\ {{copy}}

**Vim (``vi``) Basic Instruction:**\  Before writing any text you must
press (``i``). To save your text to the ``hello.py`` doc, hit (``esc``)
and then type out (``:qw``) and hit (``enter``). If this is uneffective
consult with the instructor.
