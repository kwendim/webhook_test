MongoDB as a Docker Container
-----------------------------

Let's start by pulling the docker image:

``docker pull mongo``

To run the process in the background we will add the parameter ``-d``

For administration purposes we will give the container the name mongodb:
``--name mongodb``

We have to map the tcp port from the container to the port in the docker
host, for that we use the option: ``-p HOST:CONTAINER``

Finally, to keep persitance of the data we mount the directory
``~/data`` from the host to the directory ``/data/db`` in the container
using the option ``-v``

The complete commands should looks like:

``docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -v ~/data:/data/db mongo``

You can expect the content of the container by typping:

``docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash``

To quit from the container just do: ``quit``

Now we are going to connect to the database, first we need to install
the client:

``apt-get install -y mongodb-clients``\ {{execute}}

In the next step we will connect to the database and populate it with
data.
