1. First, let’s look at Docker’s help menu in our shell

``docker -h``\ {{execute}}

2. Next, let’s check it see if we currently have any running containers

``docker ps``\ {{execute}}

3. Finally, let’s see if we have any images in our local repository

``docker images``\ {{execute}}

4. [OPTIONAL] Go through and try other Docker commands from the help
list. If you will type ``docker <command>`` you will get to see the
structure syntax.
