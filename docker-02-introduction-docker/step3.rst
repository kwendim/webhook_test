1. Now, we still don’t have a container running. We can verify that by
running the command:

``docker ps``\

2. So, let’s spin up a container. By typing ``docker run`` into our
terminal, we can review the run command’s structure, just like we did
with docker pull.

Output:

::

    docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG…]

3. Using our new ``docker/whalesay`` image, let’s spin up a container,
referring back to the previous step, if needed, for the appropriate
structuring. We won’t need to enact any options and we know the image
name. The command we are going to use is cowsay and we are going to
input ``hello-world``. It should look like this:

``docker run docker/whalesay cowsay hello-world``\

Output:

::

    < hello-world >
     ----- 
        \
         \
          \     
                        ##        .            
                  ## ## ##       ==            
               ## ## ## ##      ===            
           /""""""""""""""""___/ ===        
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~   
           \______ o          __/            
            \    \        __/             
              \____\______/
