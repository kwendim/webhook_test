Introduction to Docker
----------------------

**Objective:** An overview of Docker’s functionality working with
containers

**Preparation:** Open up two instances of your favorite shell, and a
browser window

**Outcome:** Each participant will replicate a highlight demo of some
basic functionality

**Data Files:** No data needed.

As we are learning, Docker is a container technology. When we talk about
Docker, we are talking about containers. Remember, containers are spun
up off of images, and images and spun up off of Dockerfiles. We will
talk more about creating an image from a Dockerfile later, but for now
let’s grab an existing image on Docker Hub and run a container.
